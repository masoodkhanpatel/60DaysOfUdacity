**DAY 1:**
Hi, my name is Masood Khan Patel, I hereby pledge to participate and complete the #60daysofudacity challenge.
:heavy_check_mark:Revised Lesson 2: Deep Learning with PyTorch
:heavy_check_mark:Reviewed some previous DL projects
:heavy_check_mark:Connected with peers from earlier scholarship challenge
I encourage @Tejas Jain, @Berenice and @Naushad to participate in the challenge as well if you haven't :wink::smile: and keep posting your progress everyday!
___

**DAY 2** of #60daysofudacity :
- Learn, understand and practice code of _Lesson 3: Intro to DIfferential Privacy_ and _Lesson 4: Evaluating the Privacy of a Function_ :heavy_check_mark:
- Reading and thinking about different real world use cases of differential privacy. Some reading here... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementations_of_differentially_private_analyses :heavy_check_mark:

I encourage @Dustin Gogoll to be part of this initiative.
Same goes for @annaSWE, I know it's overwhelming after successfully completing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, Congrats again!

Take some break or rest and then just at least 30 minutes a day can make a huge difference! :innocent:
___

**DAY 3** of #60daysofudacity :
- Studied a lot and completed the lesson _Intro to Local and Global DP_ :heavy_check_mark:
- Completed the mini projects in the same lesson :heavy_check_mark:
- Read more about global DP, types of noise, sensitivity, epsilon, delta etc :heavy_check_mark:

I encourage my friend @Saiteja Alampally and @Ana Hristian to be part of this initiate. Check out #announcements for more info on how to join #60daysofudacity.

- Brendan McMahan interview in the lesson _Federated Learning_ :heavy_check_mark:

I encourage @Calincan Mircea Ioan and @Naushad  to share their progress.
___

**DAY 9** of #60daysofudacity :
I came back today from a visit to rural India and by God, I must say I feel blessed to have high speed internet. I have witnessed many many people being happy even without internet access, but still it makes me sad to see the digital divide. Really makes me sad and want to do something for those who don't have access to internet to learn and grow as a society, and stay connected!
- Finished the lesson _Securing Federated Learning_ and started working on the final project of the lesson. :heavy_check_mark:
- Updating the #60daysofudacity challenge github repo. :heavy_check_mark:
https://github.com/resilientmax/60DaysOfUdacity
- Joined the study groups of my choice and looking forward to participate in study group initiatives and collaborate. :heavy_check_mark:

I thank @Berenice a lot for encouraging me to be part of the challenge and giving me inspiration, hope to graduate to Phase 2.
___

**DAY 10** of #60daysofudacity :
