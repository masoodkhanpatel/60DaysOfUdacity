*DAY 1:*
Hi, my name is Masood Khan Patel, I hereby pledge to participate and complete the #60daysofudacity challenge.
:heavy_check_mark:Revised Lesson 2: Deep Learning with PyTorch
:heavy_check_mark:Reviewed some previous DL projects
:heavy_check_mark:Connected with peers from earlier scholarship challenge
I encourage @Tejas Jain, @Berenice and @Naushad to participate in the challenge as well if you haven't :wink::smile: and keep posting your progress everyday!

*DAY 2* of #60daysofudacity :
- Learn, understand and practice code of _Lesson 3: Intro to DIfferential Privacy_ and _Lesson 4: Evaluating the Privacy of a Function_ :heavy_check_mark:
- Reading and thinking about different real world use cases of differential privacy. Some reading here... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementations_of_differentially_private_analyses :heavy_check_mark:

I encourage @Dustin Gogoll to be part of this initiative.
Same goes for @annaSWE, I know it's overwhelming after successfully completing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, Congrats again!

Take some break or rest and then just at least 30 minutes a day can make a huge difference! :innocent:

*DAY 3* of #60daysofudacity :
- Studied a lot and completed the lesson _Intro to Local and Global DP_ :heavy_check_mark:
- Completed the mini projects in the same lesson :heavy_check_mark:
- Read more about global DP, types of noise, sensitivity, epsilon, delta etc :heavy_check_mark:

I encourage my friend @Saiteja Alampally and @Ana Hristian to be part of this initiate. Check out #announcements for more info on how to join #60daysofudacity.

*DAY 4* of #60daysofudacity :
- Lesson: _Differential Privacy for Deep Learning_ :heavy_check_mark:
- PATE Analysis mini project :heavy_check_mark:
- Started working on separate github repo for #60daysofudacity challenge. 

I encourage @Berenice and @Taimur Zahid to share their progress for the day.

*DAY 5* of #60daysofudacity :
- Lesson _Federated Learning_ completed :heavy_check_mark:
- Revised all the previous lessons :heavy_check_mark:
- I encourage @Sky and @Kamil to post their progress for the day

*DAY 6* of #60daysofudacity :
- Read first two chapters of _Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy_ by Cynthia Dwork :heavy_check_mark:
- Went through PySyft codebase on github looking for ways to contribute and working on an issue :heavy_check_mark:
https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/issues
- I encourage @Rhythm and @thisladytechs to take part in this initiative and share their progress.

*DAY 7* of #60daysofudacity :
- Read more about federated learning and how it is done in real world use cases. :heavy_check_mark:
- Exploring other language bindings for PySyft like PySyft in OCaml :heavy_check_mark:
- Reading the original research by Brendan McMahan et al on federated learning. :heavy_check_mark:

I encourage @ofirbartal100 and @sabihaabc1 to share their progress for the day

*DAY 8* of #60daysofudacity :
- Continued reading _Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy_ :heavy_check_mark:
- Refactored mini projects from the previous lessons :heavy_check_mark:
- Brendan McMahan interview in the lesson _Federated Learning_ :heavy_check_mark:

I encourage @Calincan Mircea Ioan and @Naushad  to share their progress.
